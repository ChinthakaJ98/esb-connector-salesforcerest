Product: WSO2 ESB Connector for Salesforce REST API + Integration Tests

 Pre-requisites:

    - Maven 3.x
    - Java 1.8

    Tested Platforms:

    - Mac OS 10.12.6
    - WSO2 EI 6.1.1


Steps to follow in setting integration test.


 1. Download EI 6.1.1 from official website.

 2. Create a Salesforce account and create a connected app.
       i)  Using the URL "https://salesforce.com" create an account.
       ii) Create a connected app to get the clientId and clientSecret. Refer below link to create connected app.
            https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_defining_remote_access_applications.htm.

 3.Before you start performing various operations with the connector, make sure to import the Salesforce certificate to your ESB client keystore.

   Follow the steps below to import the Salesforce certificate into the EI client keystore and wso2carbon keystore:

       i.Go to your Salesforce account (e.g.,https://ap2.salesforce.com), and click the lock icon on the address bar to view the certificate.
       ii.Have a look at the certificate details and export the certificate to the file system.
       iii.Import the certificate into the ESB client keystone via the Management Console or by running the following command.

       keytool -importcert -file <certificate file> -keystore <EI>/repository/resources/security/client-truststore.jks -alias "SFDCCertImport"
       keytool -importcert -file <certificate file> -keystore <EI>/repository/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks.jks -alias "SFDCCertImport"

Don't put the same value to xxiv) and (xxviii, xxx).
